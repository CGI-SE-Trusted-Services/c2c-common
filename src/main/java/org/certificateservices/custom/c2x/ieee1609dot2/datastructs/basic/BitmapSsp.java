/**
 * This structure represents a bitmap representation of a SSP. The mapping of the bits of the bitmap to
 * constraints on the signed SPDU is PSID-specific.
 * <p>
 * <b>Consistency with issuing certificate.</b>If a certificate has an appPermissions entry A for which the ssp field is bitmapSsp, A is consistent
 * with the issuing certificate if the issuing certificate contains one of the following:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>(OPTION 1) A SubjectPermissions field indicating the choice all and no PsidSspRange field
 * containing the psid field in A;</li>
 *     <li>(OPTION 2) A PsidSspRange P for which the following holds:
 *       <ul>
 *           <li>The psid field in P is equal to the psid field in A and one of the following is true:
 *           <ul>
 *               <li>EITHER The sspRange field in P indicates all</li>
 *               <li>OR The sspRange field in P indicates bitmapSspRange and for every bit set to 1
 * in the sspBitmask in P, the bit in the identical position in the sspValue in A is set
 * equal to the bit in that position in the sspValue in P.</li>
 *           </ul>
 *           </li>
 *       </ul>
 *
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTEâ€”A BitmapSsp B is consistent with a BitmapSspRange R if for every bit set to 1 in the sspBitmask in
 * R, the bit in the identical position in B is set equal to the bit in that position in the sspValue in R. For each bit set to 0
 * in the sspBitmask in R, the corresponding bit in the identical position in B may be freely set to 0 or 1, i.e., if a bit is
 * set to 0 in the sspBitmask in R, the value of corresponding bit in the identical position in B has no bearing on
 * whether B and R are consistent.
