/**
 * This structure represents the permissions that the certificate holder has with respect to data for a single
 * application area, identified by a Psid. If the ServiceSpecificPermissions field is omitted, it indicates that the
 * certificate holder has the default permissions associated with that Psid. These permissions are Psid-specific.
 * See Annex C for further discussion.
 * <p>
 *     These permissions are PSID-specific. See Annex C for further discussion.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     <b>Consistency with signed SPDU.</b> As noted in 5.1.1, consistency between the SSP and the signed SPDU is
 * defined by rules specific to the given PSID and is out of scope for this standard.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     <b>Consistency with issuing certificate.</b>
 * If a certificate has an appPermissions entry A for which the ssp field is omitted, A is consistent with
 * the issuing certificate if the issuing certificate contains a PsidSspRange P for which the following holds:
 * <br>
 * The psid field in P is equal to the psid field in A and one of the following is true:
 *<li>The sspRange field in P indicates all.</li>
 *<li>The sspRange field in P indicates opaque and one of the entries in opaque is an OCTET
 * STRING of length 0.</li>
 * </ul>
 * For consistency rules for other forms of the ssp field, see the following subclauses.
